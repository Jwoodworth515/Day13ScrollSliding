    <p>As far as I can tell, the year is 1300 A.D and I'm being dragged to my death. Well, hello Mr. Plot Point! Ok, I hate him present tense. Retails for about $109.95. First you wanna kill me, now you wanna kiss me. You're a goody little two-shoes! Now I swear, the next one of you primates even touches me... See this? This... is my boomstick! Okay. That's it! Name's Ash. Housewares. Operation unburn Michael Westen is officially off. I had a normal life once. My name is Ash and I am a slave. It wasn't always like this. Lady, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the store. Looks like murder... is in style this season. That's right... shop smart: shop S-Mart... You got.</p>

    <p>That? I gotta make a phone call. I'll be right back, don't do anything quaint until I return. For the love of God I can smell her Chapstick! You can find this in the sporting goods department. You don't know fear, kid. You've never worked with Sam Raimi. It's got a walnut stock, cobalt-blue steel, and a hair trigger. Kid, I made a movie in Bulgaria. I'm ready for anything. But that didn't stop it, so it came back. Big time. I was vague. I said I was a freelance superhero Robin Hood kinda guy. Well, hello, Mister Fancypants. I mean, you see the section here where the C.I.A. says Ahmed is untouchable? I think that means, you know, no touching. Look, maybe I didn't say every tiny.</p>
    
    <p>Syllable, no. But basically I said them, yeah. It's a trick. Get an axe. Come on, Mike. Fiona calls, whisper whisper, all of a sudden you gotta have yogurt? What's the big secret? It was never meant for the world of the living. Good, bad... I'm the guy with the gun. It took Linda, and then it came for me. Honey, you got reeeal ugly. Next time you unleash an ancient demon, call that Buffy chick. S-Mart's top of the line. Klaatu... Barada... Shop smart: shop S-Mart! I ain't that good. Klaatu Barada NNNNNNecktie. Nectar. Nickel. Noodle. Hardware, aisle twelve. Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun. That's right, this sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It seems an archaeologist had come to this remote.</p>
    
    <p>Place to translate and study his latest find: Necronomicon ex Mortis, The Book of the Dead. Yeah, no I definitely saw that page. Just like I saw this one here: the Agency sent a team into his Bermuda compound back in '08 looking for the hard drive. They didn't find it. What makes you think we can? I had a wonderful girlfriend, Linda. Come on! Hooch! Hooch for the pooch! Well, that's why God made flashbang grenades. Hey, smooth is smooth, baby. Little goody two-shoes! Hey, is that your mom again? It's a twelve-gauge, double-barreled Remington. What are you? Are you me? Yeah, basically. Oh, you wanna know? 'Cause the answer's easy! I'm BAD Ash... and you're GOOD Ash! The book awoke something dark in the woods. He.</p>
    
    <p>Can't talk if he can't breathe. Together we drove to a small cabin in the mountains. As far as I can tell, the year is 1300 A.D and I'm being dragged to my death. Well, hello Mr. Plot Point!
